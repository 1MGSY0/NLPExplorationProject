      "He looked at me with tears in his eyes and said \"I wish I knew how you felt then.\" It was a moment I would not have dreamed possible 10 years ago when I could not stand speaking to him. My family was fairly normal. My mom adopted two of us 2 years apart along with having two of her own bio children. They said we were \"speciall\". I never bonded with my mother. She was depressed. I always felt lost and alone. This book helped me to understand my feelings and convey them to my parents in a loving, non-threatening way. I feel the prospective parents who are shying away from this \"negative\" information are setting themselves up for a lifetime of sadness and anger. The feelings adoptees have are sometimes scary but they can be dealt with in a loving way. Sherrie shows how that can be accomplished. For the sake of your adopted children please read this book. Don't get so into your fantasy that you can't deal with the reality of the child in front of you. This book is a great tool for families. It's not \"negative\". It's loving and it's real.\n"
